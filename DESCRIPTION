Description: |
    Implements dtscan, a triangle-based density clustering algorithm for planar
    point sets using Delaunay triangulation.
    Clusters emerge by iteratively linking points whose connecting edges fall
    below a user-defined distance threshold, effectively applying a dtscan-style
    density rule on the triangulation graph.
    Provides R bindings to the Rust implementation at
    <https://github.com/randogoth/xenobalanus/>. The underlying spatial clustering
    technique was proposed by Kim & Cho (2019) in
    "Delaunay triangulation-based spatial clustering technique for enhanced
    adjacent boundary detection and segmentation of LiDAR'3D point clouds."
